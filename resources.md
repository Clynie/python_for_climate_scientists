# Resources

Extensive documentation is available through the core Python reference here: https://docs.python.org/3/.

Raymond Pierrehumbert also has a webpage dedicated to learning Python with many useful links and tutorials here: https://users.physics.ox.ac.uk/~pierrehumbert/PrinciplesPlanetaryClimate/Python/pythonLearning.html

## Python libraries

### General libraries

Although they aren't released with Python, these are all well tested, documented and supported. 

 * [Numpy](http://docs.scipy.org/doc/numpy/) - Numerical array types and operations
 * [SciPy](http://docs.scipy.org/doc/scipy/reference/) - Fast linear algebra and optimisation routines
 * [Matplotlib](http://matplotlib.org/contents.html) - General plotting routines modelled on MatLab
 * [Pandas](http://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/) - Extensive (time)-series analysis routines

These aren't covered in the course but are still very well regarded and may be useful.

 * [SymPy](http://docs.sympy.org/) - Symbolic maths libary
 * [xarray](http://xarray.pydata.org/en/stable/) - For working with large arrays of data
 * [scikit-learn] (http://scikit-learn.org) - Machine learning algorithms
 * [scikit-image] (http://scikit-image.org) - Image processing algorithms

### Geo Python libraries

 * [CIS](http://cistools.net) - For working with observational data and collocation with model data
 * [Iris](http://scitools.org.uk/iris/) - For working wiht model data
 * [Cartopy](http://scitools.org.uk/cartopy/) - For plotting geo-data
 * [Shapely](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/Shapely) - For working with geometric objects (based on [geos](http://trac.osgeo.org/geos/))
 
### Optimization libraries

 * [numexpr] (https://github.com/pydata/numexpr) - Fast, multi-core array operations
 * [numba](http://numba.pydata.org) - Speeds up Python code by compiling it first
 * [mpi4py](http://pythonhosted.org/mpi4py/) - MPI bindings in Python
 
### Other libraries

 * [f2py](https://docs.scipy.org/doc/numpy-dev/f2py/) - Call compiled Fortran routines from Python
 * [recipy](https://github.com/recipy/recipy) - Keep track of all the inputs and outputs of your scripts
 * [lmfit](http://lmfit.github.io/lmfit-py/index.html) - Advanced curve fitting routines
