# Python for climate scientists

Initially forked from https://github.com/SciTools/courses this course is intended to provide a thorough grounding in Python for those working in the earth sciences.

> Note that Day 2 of this course was taught to the Oxford University NERC DTP as part of 'Large data analysis' November 2016.

The course is split into three days:
